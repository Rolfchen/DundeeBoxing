	<h1>Dundeeâ€™s Fight for Respect</h1>
    <p>At a young age, Dundee began learning boxing simply to protect himself. But with determination and talent he soon became a two time amateur boxing champion representing his home state in South Korea. He received further combat training while serving his country in the national army service in South Korea. Realising the importance of knowledge, Dundee continues his journey not only in boxing but also in studying and absorbing as much information  as he can. He has travelled the world and is now a multilingual speaker in Japanese, Chinese, English and his native tongue Korean.</p>
