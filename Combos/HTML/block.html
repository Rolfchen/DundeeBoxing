    	<p>Move the body as one unit, bending at the knees and waist simultaneously. Twist to your left to defend against punches thrown from the left; twist to the right to defend against punches thrown from the right. The movement should move your forearms to the lower portion of your body. Make sure your elbow is pointed at your knees and both hands are held close to the chin so you are in position to be able to counter with either hand.
