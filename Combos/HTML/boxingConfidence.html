    <p>Dundee’s Boxing & Fitness (Dundee’s Body Care Pty Ltd) offers Boxing Courses which have been accredited by Fitness Australia. This type of boxing course is rarely offered by other Australian boxing gyms. Dundee’s Boxing & Fitness is teaching correct boxing and fighting technique to Personal Trainers and professional boxers alike. This same quality technique is also being taught to our corporate clients. </p>
    <p>
Boxing is a proven exercise that is extremely popular for weight loss and fitness in today’s modern society. You can often see people boxing in a park or in gyms. Our trainers use correct boxing technique to offer a full body workout, helping clients lose weight and improve their fitness levels.
</p>There are two different types of boxing: One for fitness and one for serious boxers. I want to talk about fitness boxing. 
<p>Fitness boxing involves people doing pad work without basic boxing skills, they just want to improve their fitness level and lose weight. They might want to keep it simple as they do not want to think too much after work.</p>
<p>My recommendation is that it is better to learn proper boxing skills if they want to improve their fitness levels.</p>
<p>It is more effective and efficient, and you will use more muscles and energy than people who just do pad work without proper boxing skills.<p>
<p>This boxing course improves your specific boxing skill, as well as improves your muscle groups such as calf, hamstring, back, arm and core muscles. </p>
<p>When you first learn it may be challenging, but gradually you see noticeable changes in speed, reaction times, coordination, tone of your muscles and confidence.
