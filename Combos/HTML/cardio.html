	<p>Your cardio routine should get your heart rate up while helping you practice the kind of moves you will need in the ring.<br />
    </p>
<h2>Back/Forward/Side Jogging</h2>
<p>This is best done in a workout room where you can jog around the perimeter of the room. Ease into the exercise by jogging forward for several laps. Then, making sure to watch behind you, jog backward for a lap. Then, jog going sideways leading with your right foot so that you face the inside of the circle. And finally, jog going sideways leading with the left foot so that you are facing the outside of the circle.</p><p>
  After a warm-up lap going in each direction, keep jogging in the circle, switching up which direction you are going every few seconds.</p>
   <h2>Shadow Boxing</h2>
<p>Facing a mirror so that you can check your form, practice each of the moves you would use in the ring. Start with a simple combination and work your way up to something more complicated. </p><p>
For example, start with a simple 1-2-3-4 combination (jab, cross, hook, uppercut) and work up to a more complicated combination of moves. The objective here is to check form and keep your heart rate up. </p>
<p>After a warm-up lap going in each direction, keep jogging in the circle, switching up which direction you are going every few seconds.</p>
<h2>Jump Rope</h2>
<p>Jump roping keeps the heart rate up, strengthens arms and legs, and teaches quick footwork. Try jump roping for 3 minutes at a time, then resting for a minute--the same pattern of time you would be boxing in a ring.</p><p>
As you jump rope, switch up the way you are jumping. Try jumping with your feet moving in a shuffle pattern, crossing your arms as you jump or double jumping (making the rope move twice under your feet before your feet hit the ground again). </p>
