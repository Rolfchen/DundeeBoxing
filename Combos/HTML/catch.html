    	<p>Catch-when an attacking boxer throws a straight punch, the defending boxer moves his opposite hand towards the on-coming punch using the palm of the glove to block the shot. Never reach for the punch. This defensive technique will gradually cause fatigue because the punches are absorbed and is limited because it leaves only one hand free to punch. After blocking an attack with one hand the boxer will now have a free hand and be in position to counter. This technique is easy to perform and is great for beginners. </p>
