	<h1>Instructions</h1>
	<p>Your choice of equipment depends on what type of boxing you want to do:<br /><br />
    	<strong>Boxing for cardio? </strong><br />
or <br />
<strong>Boxing for competition?</strong><br /><br />
If it’s boxing for cardio and conditioning, all you will need is a set of bag gloves and at least one pair of wrist wraps.
If it’s boxing for competition, you will need several pairs of hand wraps, bag gloves, sparring gloves and protective equipment.

	<h1>Gloves</h1>
	<p>Bag gloves will be used strictly for hitting bags. They should weigh between 12 to 16 oz. and be Velcro sealed.
Sparring gloves will be used when sparring another person in practice. They should weigh between 16 to 18 oz. and be tied up with laces. Try on sparring gloves to make sure there is proper support on the wrist and that the feeling is right.

	<h1>Protective Equipment</h1>
	<p>For sparring, buy head gear, athletic cup (if male) and a mouth guard. When selecting head gear, choose gear that fits comfortably. It should have adequate padding on the sides of the head, cheekbones and jaw line. </p><p>
For the mouth guard, place it in hot water for several minutes. Take it out and place it in your mouth, allowing it to form to the unique structure of your mouth.
