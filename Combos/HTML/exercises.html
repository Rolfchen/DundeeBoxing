	<h1>Strength Moves</h1>
	<p>Building muscle serves two purposes in boxing. It helps you land stronger, faster punches and helps protect you when you get hit. 
Push-ups and crunches are the best basic moves for boxers to practice. These moves train the areas where you will be getting hit and require no additional equipment. Try these variations to add even more power to your workout.</p>
	<h2>Push-up Variations</h2>
	<ul>
    	<li><strong>Standard push-ups: </strong> Legs are straight out behind you while hands are under your shoulders. </li>
        <li><strong>Diamonds:</strong> Legs are in a V-shape. Hands are together with the forefingers and thumbs touching to make a diamond shape under your chest.</li>
        <li><strong>Wide grips:</strong> Legs are straight out behind you. Hands are set farther away from your body so that your body makes a "y" shape.</li>
        <li><strong>Knuckles:</strong> Legs are straight out behind you. Hands are in fists under your shoulders.</li>
        <li><strong>Fingertips:</strong> Legs are straight out behind you. Hands are in the standard push-up position, however you will balance yourself on your fingertips.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Crunch Variations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Basic crunch:</strong> Hands are behind the head. Feet are flat on the floor so that the knees are bent at a 45-degree angle.</li>
      <li><strong>Obliques 1:</strong> Hands are behind the head. One foot is flat on the floor so that the knee is bent at a 45-degree angle. The other foot rests on the opposite knee. Repeat on each side.</li>
      <li><strong>Obliques 2:</strong> Hands are behind the head. Legs lay to one side, resting on top of each other. Repeat for each side.</li>
      <li><strong>Rope climb:</strong> Hands are straight out from the chest at a right angle from the body. Legs are extended up at right angle from the body. As you crunch, move your arms as though you are climbing a rope. </li>
