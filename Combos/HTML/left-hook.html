	<h1>Movements</h1>
    <p>Start from your boxer’s stance and focus on your open target.
</p>
    <ul class="moveList">
    	<li>Dip your elbow towards your hip. 80% of the time this punch will be thrown from an inside position.</li>
        <li>Transfer your weight to the left foot and bring your chin down into the inside of your left shoulder.</li>
<li>Pivot on the ball of your left foot from 6 o’clock to 3 o’clock keeping hips and hand in 
    the direction of your punch.</li>
<li>Quickly turn and rotate your hips and torso.</li>
<li>Move your arm at the same time as your body; it does not move independently. Your forearm becomes parallel to the ground and your elbow moves with your hips as though they are one.</li>
<li>Turn your hand over so that at the point of impact your palm faces down.</li>
<li>The punch is about a six-inch punch, make sure to keep it short and compact with your arm bent forming the shape of a hook.</li>
<li>Return to your boxing stance and tuck the punch into your chest upon completion.</li>
  </ul>
 
 <p><strong>Note:</strong>If throwing a hook to the body, flex your knees slightly moving the entire body down.  Make sure you do not draw back, 
loop, or extend your  arm far from your body. Also do not throw the hook too close to your opponent or you will wind up 
Hugging them. (Same method applies for right hook) </p>
