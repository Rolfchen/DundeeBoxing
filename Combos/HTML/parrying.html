    	<p>It is the back hand (right hand) that parries the incoming jab.
The mechanics of parrying an incoming jab are:
The first move is a push from the back foot.  This push from the back 
foot provides the drive to rotate the hips and upper body in a counter-
clockwise direction. </p>
<p>
The back hand (right hand) moves from the guard position, palm open, 
and makes contact with the opponent's jabbing arm on the outside (the 
right side as you look at it) of the wrist. 
</p>
<p>
The opponent's jab should be pushed from your right to left.  As the 
parry is taking place, the right hand should not move beyond the line of 
the left hand (economy of movement is vital.) 
After parrying the shot, the hand returns instantly to the 'home' position. 
</p>
<p>
Ensure that the right hand moves no more than 3 to 5 inches away from 
the 'home' position otherwise a large gap will be left in your own 
defence! 
</p>
<p>
The move becomes an 'arm only' action.  If the initial drive is not 
provided by the back foot pushing (thereby rotating the upper body), 
then it is highly likely that the arm will not be strong enough to deflect 
the jab.  This parry, as with blocking the jab, is a platform for 
counterpunching.  This is an opportunity wasted and against a high 
standard of opponent opportunities don't come along that 
often.  Furthermore, when you throw your counterpunch, it must be 
instant.
