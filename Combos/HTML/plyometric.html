	<h2>Laddder Drills</h2>
<p>Boxers need quick footwork and endurance in the smaller muscles or the leg to maintain the movement during a match. Ladder drills help with both coordination and endurance. Ladder drills can range from simple to complex. For boxing, the simple drills will be effective in producing the desired results. The most basic ladder drill is the one-in. This is performed by facing the ladder and stepping one foot into the first box of the ladder. Now step your other foot into the second box. Continue until you are through the ladder. The two-in is a little more advanced. Facing the ladder, step your first foot into the first box. Now step your second foot in the same box. Step the first foot to the second box followed by the other foot and repeat all the way down. </p>
<h2>Jumps</h2>
<p>There are a variety of plyometric jumps that increase lower body power. While the muscles of the upper body deliver the force, the lower body is the source, both as the base and generator. Box jumps provide a soft landing and an easy measurable. A good box jump for boxing is the depth jump. Begin by standing on a box that is facing a taller box. Jump off the box and to the floor. As soon as you touch the floor, explosively jump back up to the second box. There are body weight jumps that are good for boxers. One is the 180-degree jump. Begin with your feet slightly wider than shoulder width. Keep your hands off your hips and squat down until your thighs are parallel to the floor. Explosively come up from the squat and push off the ground, using your core to rotate in the air. You should land facing the opposite way as you began.<br />
