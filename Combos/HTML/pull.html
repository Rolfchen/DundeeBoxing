    	<p>Pull as opponent attacks, the boxer leans back without moving their feet, bending the back leg whilst keeping the front leg relatively straight with the knee soft and relaxed. 
The movement should be slight with little effort. This technique is advanced and quite safe, once the opponent has committed to the attack a counter can be launched from both hands with an explosive push from the rear foot. Â
