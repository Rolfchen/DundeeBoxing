  <h1>Rhythm</h1>
  <p>
  	Rhythm, timing, power, speed and quickness are vital characteristics a boxer must have when he enters the ring. 
They are all based on footwork. The ability to throw an effective punch or a series of punches is based on getting in the right position to 
deliver the blow without exposing oneself more than necessary.</p>
<p>The two types of rhythm in boxing is Side to Side and back and Forth. The Student may feel more comfortable doing both or just one depending on their personal preference. </p>
<p><strong>Side to Side</strong> is either an inside, outside, or a U-slip movement. Side to side also includes a bounce in the lower body. </p>
<p><strong>Back and Forth</strong> is a pulling type movement which includes an added bounce in the waist, legs, feet and knees. </p>

<h1>Style</h1>	
   <ul class="moveList">
    	<li>There are three main types of styles that boxers fall into when boxing. These reflect how they move and how they punch. It is generally thought that the styles are a lot like rock, paper, scissors in that one style beats another while it will generally lose to the third. However, this has been disproved many times and is only accepted as true.
</li>
        <li>The first style we will mention is the Brawler (Bull). This type of boxer will generally throw single and powerful punches against their opponent. A lot of brawlers are able to throw a punch which can knock out an opponent in a single blow. The biggest problem with this fighting technique is how slow the boxers usually are to punch. By being so slow they can be countered a lot more easily.
</li>
<li>Inside-style is that of the Inside Fighter. This type of style is usually played very aggressively and incorporates an "in your face" type of play. The idea is for the boxer to get and stay close to his opponent and knock him out with multiple fast punches. This is a great class to be used by medium weight boxers.
</li>
<li>Boxer-style is that of the Outside Fighter. Boxers who use this style type will generally stay toward the outside of the ring and work on keeping their opponents away from them. The idea is to wear out your opponent rather than knock him out. This style is usually played by lighter class boxers who don't have the strength for heavy punches.
