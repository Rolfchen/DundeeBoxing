	<h2>Strength Training</h2>
<p>Strength training is a foundational way to build up muscle and increase performance for any sport. Since boxing focuses on throwing punches to the head and body, strengthening the upper body and midsection is especially important for boxers. To increase strength, athletes generally lift heavy loads of free weights, in small to medium sized sets. Bench press, biceps curls, triceps extensions, military shoulder press, push-ups, sit ups, and pull ups are common exercise used to increase upper body and core strength. An athlete will usually allow at least a day to rest in between heavy lifting for the same muscle group. </p>
<h2>Speed Training</h2>
<p>Another essential component of attaining boxing shape is working on speed - both hand speed and foot speed. One common speed workout is to use a speed bag (a small rounded pad suspended near head level) that can be punched in a rapid rhythm. A larger, cylindrical bag is used to practice quick combinations to different targets. Foot speed is improved though through sprints, drills involving hopping on one foot in different patterns quickly, and jumping rope. <br />
