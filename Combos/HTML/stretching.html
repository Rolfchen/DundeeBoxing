	<h1>Warming Up</h1>
	<p>Warming up is crucial to a boxing workout. You're going to be working out your whole body, so you need to protect yourself from injury by making sure your body is ready to really work.Hold each stretch for at least 25 seconds before moving to another stretch.
    
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Hamstrings: </strong>Sit on the floor with one leg extended and the other foot pressed against the inside of the extended thigh. Bend forward at the waist with your back straight and try to lay your chest on your extended leg. Repeat with the other leg.</li>
    <li><strong>Quadriceps: </strong>Sit on the floor Indian style, then take one foot and pull it behind you so that your legs are making a little triangle. Supporting yourself with your arms, lean backward until you feel the stretch in the quad. Repeat with the other leg.
    <li><strong>Shoulders: </strong>Take one arm and pull it in front of the top of your chest with the other arm until you feel the pull in your shoulder. Repeat with the other arm.</li>
    <li><strong>Triceps: </strong>Extend one arm straight up above your head, then bend that arm at the elbow so that your hand touches the back of your shoulder. With the other hand, push your arm backward until you feel the tug in your triceps. Repeat with the other arm.</li>
    <li><strong>Biceps: </strong>Extend your arm in front of you at a right angle with your chest with the palm facing up. With your other hand, bend the extended hand backward, bringing the fingers back toward your body while pushing your extended arm forward. Repeat with the other arm.</li>
    <li>Neck: Reach over your head with one hand and place that hand on the opposite ear. Gently pull your head over until you feel the stretch in your neck. Repeat on the other side.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Abs: </strong>Lay on your stomach with your hands at your chest and your legs extended behind you. Push up with your arms until you feel the stretch in your abdomen. </li>
    
    </ul>

	<h1>Cool Down</h1>
	<p>After a serious strength workout, lactic acid and tension can build up in your muscles. Make sure to cool down to release some of these workout by products. <br />
Repeat the stretches from the warm up. You may be more flexible at this point in the workout, so be sure not to over stretch as you are cooling down. </p>
