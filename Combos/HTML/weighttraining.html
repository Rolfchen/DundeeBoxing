<p>Use heavy weight with low reps to build up strength for powerful punches. As we all know, powerful punches are generated from the 
ground up. From your legs, to your chest, to your shoulders, and out to your arms. Use somewhat lighter weightier that allow you to perform 
than 10 repetitions per set. Heavier weights and lower repetitions build mass, while higher reps with lower weights increases stamina while
Still improving power.</p>
<p>
Perform a circuit training routine, where you move from one weightlifting machine or station to another without rest. Use light weights at each 
That allow you to quickly perform reps for 30 seconds consecutively and then immediately move to the next weight training station. 
</p>
<p>
If you combine weightlifting into one workout with traditional boxing exercises, perform the boxing portion first,.  Weightlifting first can tire 
you out and leave you prone to technical mistakes and sloppy form while boxing.
